QTMACS
======

Qtmacs is an Emacs inspired macro framework for Qt. It consists of
task related applets and widget specific macros.

Applets are basically plain windows that can house arbitrary
code and widgets. Within Qtmacs, they provide the functionailty to
eg. edit text, view a PDF file, or browse the web.

Macros, on the other hand, govern the behaviour of individual widgets
in response to keyboard input. They are are applicable to any Qt based
widget.

Both, applets and macros, are supplied via Python modules and can be
changed during runtime to customise the functionality and behaviour of
Qtmacs as required.
