        Set the policy on how Qtmacs filters keyboard events for a
        particular widgets.

        The options can be arbitrarily combined, eg. ::

            widget.qteSetKeyFilterPolicy(True, True, False)

        will first pass the event to the applet's ``keyPressEvent``
        method and afterwards pass the same event to Qtmacs' keyboard
        filter.

        For all text-processing widgets (eg. ``QLineEdit``,
        ``QTextEdit``, ``QWebView``, etc.) it is almost always a good
        idea to use the default, ie. (False, True, False, False),
        which lets Qtmacs process everything. In this case the only
        way to interact with the widget is via macros (and the mouse).

        If ``receiveBefore`` and/or ``receiveAfter`` is set then
        ``qteKeyPressEventBefore`` and/or ``qteKeyPressEventAfter`` of
        the QtmacsApplet (not widget) is called to inspect the event.

        .. note:: The default behaviour is to let Qtmacs handle all
           keyboard events and interact with the applet only via
           macros. It may be more convenient for a programmer to
           handle keyboard events directly in the keyPressEvent
           routine, as is customary with Qt applications, but this
           compromises the customisation ability of Qtmacs. As a rule
           of thumb, applet classes should not implement keyPressEvent
           at all. However, since there is an exception to every rule
           Qtmacs allows it.

class QtmacsKeysequence(object):
    """
    Parse and represent a Qtmacs keyboard sequence.

    Without any argument, it represents an empty sequence. If the
    argument is a string or a list/tuple, then a parser attempts to
    convert it into a sequence of valid ``QKeyEvent`` objects. If the
    argument is another QtmacsKeysequence, then a copy of the object
    is returned.

    Examples for instantiating this object with human readable
    keyboard sequences::

        QtmacsKeysequence('<ctrl>+f h <alt>+K <ctrl>+k')
        QtmacsKeysequence('<ctrl>+f <ctrl>+<alt>++ <ctrl>+<alt>+<space>')
        QtmacsKeysequence('<ctrl>+f <ctrl>+F <ctrl>++ <ctrl>+<space>'
                          '<ctrl>+< <alt>+> < > <space>')

    The syntax of the string should be self explanatory. In addition,
    everything in angular brackets is case insensitive, eg. '<ctrl>-f'
    and '<CtRL>-f' are the same, and so is '<space>' and
    '<SPAce>'. However, non-bracketed keys are case sensitive,
    eg. '<ctrl>-f>' is not the same as '<ctrl>+F'. Note that it is not
    necessary (in fact impossible) to specify a <shift> modifier.

    Keyboard combination are separated by (an arbitrary number of)
    white spaces. Non-printable characters have a bracketed mnemonic,
    eg. <space>, <backspace>, <tab>, <F1>. The exact list of available
    characters, as well as the necessity for <shift> modifiers,
    depends on the used OS and keyboard. The used layout is specified
    in ``Qt_keymap`` variable from the global name space which
    ``QtmacsMain`` sets at startup, although it utilises the
    ``platform_setup.py`` module to do the actual work. That module is
    also the point of entry for adding new key maps, and/or extending
    existing ones.

    Instead of specifying a human readable string it is also possible
    to instantiate ``QtmacsKeyboardsequence`` with sequence of Qt
    constants from the ``QtCore.Qt`` name space, for instance::

        QtmacsKeysequence([(QtCore.Qt.ControlModifier, QtCore.Qt.Key_H),
                       (QtCore.Qt.NoModifier, QtCore.Qt.Key_K)])

    is the same as::

        QtmacsKeysequence('<ctrl>+h k').

    The macro/applet programmer is unlikely to encounter this class at
    all as the methods of these classes that require keyboard
    sequences (eg. ``qteBindKeyWidget``) are usually called
    with human readable strings anyway because they are convenient.
    However, Qtmacs internally, the only accepted way to deal with
    keyboard shortcuts is via this class.

    |Args|

    * ``keysequence`` (**str** or **tuple** or **list** or
      **QtmacsKeysequence**)
