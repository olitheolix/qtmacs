Format and display log-messages.

This applet creates an instance of ``QtmacsLoggingHandler`` which, in
turn, is linked into the Qtmacs wide logging mechanism (which is taken
from the ``logger`` module in the standard Python library).

It displays all received log messages and applies basic formatting to
distinguish between debug/status messages (black), warnings (blue),
and errors (red). If a stack trace is available it prints a formatted
version of it that resembles the stack trace usually seen by the
Python interpreter itself.

This applet is based on ``QTextEdit`` and thus capable of interpreting
HTML tags. For instance, calling::

    qteMain.qteLogger.info('This is a <b>bold</b> statement')

will result in the message \"This is a **bold** statement\".

.. note: This is (one of the few) modules that Qtmacs automatically
   registers and instantiates at startup.

As with every applet, do **not** use::
